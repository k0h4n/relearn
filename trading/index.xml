Turtle Trading System is rules-based trend-following strategy developed by legendary commodity trader Richard Dennis in the 1980s. Below are the rule for trading:
1. Position Size &amp; Risk Management (Unit System) The maximum portion size are 2% of your current portofolio and you have to calculate it after every trade. It is recommended to use only 1% of your portofolio. For entry you have to calculate unit size. Unit Size are calculated based on you portion size (in this case 1%) and divided by ATR (Average True Range) times by 2 (maximum loss are 2 ATR). In the formula ATR will be known as N. So the formula should be like Unit Size = 1% * portfolio / 2N.</description></item></channel></rss>
